Problem I
Star Guardians

Jenny and Ojas are part of an elite group of competitive programmers called the Star Guardians. Their next job - to do well in the NAQ!

The Star Guardians are working to assemble a team for the NAQ. They are yet to decide their team, but for each person in the group, it is known how many problems that person will solve.

The Star Guardians are also well-versed in teamwork, so they will solve an additional number of problems based solely on the size of their team.

The Star Guardians want to field a team that maximizes the average number of problems solved per team member. Compute the maximum average they can attain. You may assume the NAQ has infinitely many problems, so the Star Guardians will not run out of problems to solve.

The first line of input contains a single integer,
(

, the number of Star Guardians.
