You and your friends are playing the popular childhood game, Mingle.

In the game of Mingle,
players start by standing on a spinning circular platform in the middle of a circular arena. Each player has a unique number ranging from to , and there are rooms also with unique numbers from to arranged on the perimeter of the arena. The rooms are in numerical order, with room also being adjacent to room

Cheerful music plays for a few seconds, and then the music stops, the circular platform stops spinning, and everyone has to run into a room. Initially, each player tries to target the room with the same number as their number, but because of the spinning, everyone is disoriented. As a result, player
might enter a different room. Notably, the players have a disorientation factor of , which is the same for all players, and player might enter a room that is up to rooms away from their target room. All

candidate rooms are equally likely for each player and all players select their rooms independently. Every player who ends up alone in a room is a winner in that round of Mingle, even if the room’s number is not the same as the player’s number.

Compute the expected number of winners in a single round of Mingle.
