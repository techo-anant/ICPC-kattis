Problem M
Utopia Relationships

In the Kingdom of Utopia, society has become highly digitized, even in relationships. The governor has built a massive database system of billions of GPUs to record relationships of its residents. Between any two residents, it is required that if they are acquaintances, they have to be registered in the kingdom’s database. Note that a registered relationship is mutual: if
is registered to be an acquaintance of , then is also registered as an acquaintance of

.

In the last effort to fully digitize relationships, King Aurelius IV proposes “numerical affectionate points”. Every resident of the Utopia Kingdom is given
affectionate points. The residents are then required to distribute their affectionate points to the other residents that have registered their relationship in the database. For example, if has registered to be an acquaintance to and , can distribute affectionate points to , and affectionate points to . If is not registered to , can not give any affectionate point. Residents can distribute any integral quantity of affection points, from to

inclusive.

The King wants to make sure that points distribution is fair and equal: if
gives affectionate point, then must also give the same affectionate points. Further, a resident must also distribute all of their affectionate points; the sum of all affectionate points that a resident distributes to their acquaintances must be

.

The King gives you the database of registered relationships, and he wants you to figure out if it is possible for the Kingdom to implement this protocol. You must determine if the king’s scheme is possible, and if it is, you must give the King a valid affectionate point distribution.
